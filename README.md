This repository is for my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code puzzles.

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

Although performance is a non-issue, I will try to use what I think are reasonably optimal solutions.
